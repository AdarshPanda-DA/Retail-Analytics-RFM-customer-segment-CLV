🚀 Project Completed: Retail Customer Behavior & RFM Analysis | Power BI Dashboard
I’m excited to share my end-to-end RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Customer Segmentation project, where I transformed raw retail transaction data into actionable business insights using SQL, Python and PowerBI.
🔍 What I Did
This project focuses on understanding customer purchasing behavior and enabling data-driven decision-making through advanced segmentation.
✔ Cleaned and processed raw retail data using SQL(mySQL Database)
 ✔ Calculated RFM metrics using python(pandas, numpy) for accurate customer scoring
 ✔ Segmented customers into Champions, potential Loyalists, Loyal, At Risk, Hibernating
 ✔ Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with KPIs, slicers, and dynamic visuals
